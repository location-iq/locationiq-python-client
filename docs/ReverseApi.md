Reverse Geocoding

Reverse geocoding is the process of converting a coordinate or location (latitude, longitude) to a readable address or place name. This permits the identification of nearby street addresses, places, and/or area subdivisions such as a neighborhood, county, state, or country.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (key):
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: key
configuration.api_key['key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['key'] = 'Bearer'

# Defining host is optional and default to https://eu1.locationiq.com/v1
configuration.host = "https://eu1.locationiq.com/v1"
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.ReverseApi(api_client)
    lat = 40.7487727 # float | Latitude of the location to generate an address for.
lon = -73.9849336 # float | Longitude of the location to generate an address for.
format = '\"json\"' # str | Format to geocode. Only JSON supported for SDKs
normalizecity = 1 # int | Normalizes village to city level data to city
addressdetails = 1 # int | Include a breakdown of the address into elements. Defaults to 1. (optional) (default to 1)
accept_language = '\"en\"' # str | Preferred language order for showing search results, overrides the value specified in the Accept-Language HTTP header. Defaults to en. To use native language for the response when available, use accept-language=native (optional)
namedetails = 0 # int | Include a list of alternative names in the results. These may include language variants, references, operator and brand. (optional)
extratags = 0 # int | Include additional information in the result if available, e.g. wikipedia link, opening hours. (optional)
statecode = 0 # int | Adds state or province code when available to the statecode key inside the address element. Currently supported for addresses in the USA, Canada and Australia. Defaults to 0 (optional)
showdistance = 0 # int | Returns the straight line distance (meters) between the input location and the result's location. Value is set in the distance key of the response. Defaults to 0 [0,1] (optional)
postaladdress = 0 # int | Returns address inside the postaladdress key, that is specifically formatted for each country. Currently supported for addresses in Germany. Defaults to 0 [0,1] (optional)

    try:
        # Reverse Geocoding
        api_response = api_instance.reverse(lat, lon, format, normalizecity, addressdetails=addressdetails, accept_language=accept_language, namedetails=namedetails, extratags=extratags, statecode=statecode, showdistance=showdistance, postaladdress=postaladdress)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ReverseApi->reverse: %s\n" % e)
```
