[**search**](SearchApi.md#search) | **GET** /search.php | Forward Geocoding


# **search**
> list[Location] search(q, format, normalizecity, addressdetails=addressdetails, viewbox=viewbox, bounded=bounded, limit=limit, accept_language=accept_language, countrycodes=countrycodes, namedetails=namedetails, dedupe=dedupe, extratags=extratags)

Forward Geocoding

The Search API allows converting addresses, such as a street address, into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). These coordinates can serve various use-cases, from placing markers on a map to helping algorithms determine nearby bus stops. This process is also known as Forward Geocoding.

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import locationiq
from locationiq.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: key
configuration = locationiq.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['key'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = locationiq.SearchApi(locationiq.ApiClient(configuration))
q = "Empire state building" # str | Address to geocode
format = "json" # str | Format to geocode. Only JSON supported for SDKs
normalizecity = 1 # int | For responses with no city value in the address section, the next available element in this order - city_district, locality, town, borough, municipality, village, hamlet, quarter, neighbourhood - from the address section will be normalized to city. Defaults to 1 for SDKs.
addressdetails = 1 # int | Include a breakdown of the address into elements. Defaults to 0. (optional)
viewbox = (-132.84908,47.69382,-70.44674,30.82531) # tuple of 4 floats | The preferred area to find search results.  To restrict results to those within the viewbox, use along with the bounded option. (optional)
bounded = 1 # int | Restrict the results to only items contained with the viewbox (optional)
limit = 10 # int | Limit the number of returned results. Default is 10. (optional) (default to 10)
accept_language = "en" # str | Preferred language order for showing search results, overrides the value specified in the Accept-Language HTTP header. Defaults to en. To use native language for the response when available, use accept-language=native (optional)
countrycodes = "US" # str | Limit search to a list of countries. (optional)
namedetails = 1 # int | Include a list of alternative names in the results. These may include language variants, references, operator and brand. (optional)
dedupe = 1 # int | Sometimes you have several objects in OSM identifying the same place or object in reality. The simplest case is a street being split in many different OSM ways due to different characteristics. Nominatim will attempt to detect such duplicates and only return one match; this is controlled by the dedupe parameter which defaults to 1. Since the limit is, for reasons of efficiency, enforced before and not after de-duplicating, it is possible that de-duplicating leaves you with less results than requested. (optional)
extratags = 0 # int | Include additional information in the result if available, e.g. wikipedia link, opening hours. (optional)

try:
    # Forward Geocoding
    api_response = api_instance.search(q, format, normalizecity, addressdetails=addressdetails, viewbox=viewbox, bounded=bounded, limit=limit, accept_language=accept_language, countrycodes=countrycodes, namedetails=namedetails, dedupe=dedupe, extratags=extratags)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling SearchApi->search: %s\n" % e)
```
